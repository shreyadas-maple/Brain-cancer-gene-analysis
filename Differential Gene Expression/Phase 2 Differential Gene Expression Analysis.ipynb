    "\n",
    "In order to understand which statistically significant genes have increased or decreased gene expression, we need to analyze the t-test that we calculated in the previous phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we would calculate fold-change for the gene expression. However, in our current dataset the values that are listed under each genes are not counts of RNA transcripts for each of the genes and are rather gene expression data from multiple sources of DNA microarrays. From the published paper, the authors stated that very high values of gene expression were interpreted as 'high gene expression' and negative or low values of gene expression were interpreted as 'low gene expression'. Quickly looking at the original data, we see that there are no negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the statistics that we calculated, the t-test has both negative and positive values. The sign of the t-test statistic is not relevant to the level of significance (in most cases, people will only take the absolute value of the t-statistic), but rather defines which group has the lower mean (if the value is negative, this means that the first group has a lower mean than the second group). In the Wlech's t-test function that we program, the first group given is the experimental group (cancer) and the second group is the control group (healthy). This means we can interprete a negative Welch's t-test value as a reversal of the directionalty of the effect (gene expression) being studied, or that gene expression is lower in the experimental group compared to the control group.
